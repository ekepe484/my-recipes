    <li><img src="../images/eru2.jpeg" width="1000" height="auto" alt="Image of cameroonian dish eru, also known as afang soup in nigeria."></li>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Eru soup is made using the creeping planting Gnetum africanum – an evergreen vine that grows wild in the forests of Central and West Africa.The leaves go under different aliases; Okazi, Eru, Mfumbwa, and Ukase depending on the region and country.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds meat (beef, tripe, cow skin, smoked turkey)</li>
        <li>1½ pounds dried fish</li>
        <li>¼ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2-4 cups palm oil (or half corn oil and half palm oil)</li>
        <li>½ cup ground crayfish</li>
        <li>5-6 cups dried chopped ukazi</li>
        <li>2 pounds frozen spinach</li>
        <li>2 Maggi/bouillon powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet pepper optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into bite-size chunks, season with salt, Maggi, and onions, and cook until tender. Do the same with cow skin (they are tough, so they take longer to get soft). Use very little water while cooking the meat because eru does not need a lot of water. However, make sure you have at least 2-3 cups of stock from the beef to use in cooking this dish.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, soak the dried okazi (eru) leaves in a bowl of hot water to tenderize the leaves for 10-15 minutes. Rinse and drain.</li>
        <li>Add the assorted meats – beef, cow skin, tripe, and dried fish or turkey to a large stock pot with at least 2 cups of stock. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the thawed spinach and add to the pot of assorted meat and fish. Add crayfish and two tablespoons of bouillon/Maggi. Stir and cook on medium heat for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded ukazi (eru) leaves and red oil. Stir again thoroughly, making sure all the contents in the pot blend together. Simmer for another 10 minutes; add stock or water if needed. The fragrant aroma lets you know it is time to eat.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt and more Maggi as needed.</li>
    </ol>
